I finally found a place in downtown Seattle - it's a 2-bedroom apartment on Pine Street, unit 4B. The rent is $2,400 a month which is pretty steep but worth it for the location. My new phone number is 206-555-0123 in case you need to reach me. The lease started on March 15th and I'll be here for at least a year. 

  Oh, and I started a new job at TechFlow Solutions as a Senior Software Engineer. The pay is great - $145,000 annually plus benefits. My manager is Jennifer Chen and she seems really cool. The office is just a 10-minute walk from my apartment which is perfect!

  By the way, my birthday is coming up on August 22nd - I'm turning 29 this year. Maybe we can plan something? Also, I need to update my emergency contact info everywhere. Can you help me remember to change it to my brother Mike? His number is 415-555-0987.
